            Impact on Land
        </h2>
        <p class="landinfo">
            450 years. That is how long it takes for a plastic bottle to decompose in soil 
            or <br> sediment. That's around the lifespan of 5 people. How much plastic do you 
            use <br> in your daily life? How many bottles? It takes the time of five lifespans 
            for <br> one measly little plastic bottle to decompose. Decomposing plastic may 
            seem <br> beneficial, and it is for the most part, but it unearths (no pun intended) 
            a new <br> problem. When plastics decompose, they release toxic substances into the 
            soil. <br> This impacts ecosystems and risks biodiversity loss.
            <br>
            <br>Biodiversity is important because, without it, the balance and cycles of a 
            natural <br>system can and will cause extinction. You may think the earthworm is a 
            disgusting <br>creature, but it is one of the reasons why crop production has been 
            steady <br>over the years. Microorganisms like these plough through the soil day and
            night to <br>make room for plants and trees to flourish. and without them, there
            would be <br>a significantly less amount of trees, which means less clean air, more 
            pollution, <br>and that could lead to the extinction of a species, and their biological 
            relationship <br>would shatter, leading to a chain reaction of extinction.
