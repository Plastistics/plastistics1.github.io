            We use plastic everday, from packaging, toys, bottles. But we use too much <br> much of it ends up
            back into the natural world, notably Our Ocean. Plastic <br> jeopardises the natural ambience of marine life. 
            It disrupts the entire bio-geo <br> cycle causing unwanted problems to the whole marine eco-system. Not only <br> this but
            plastic threatens the existence of life underwater right from smaller <br> fishes to huge mammals and amphibians in several ways.
            Microplastiscs are an <br> even bigger threat to the oceans as it not only affects marine life but also us, <br> humans, read more below to find out why.
